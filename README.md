# Fundamentals-of-Kubernetes-and-Docker-
This repository includes the basic commands of container orchestration tools like Kubernetes (K8) and Docker.
Docker is a set of platforms as a service product that uses OS-level virtualisation to deliver software in packages called containers. 
Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. 

Kubernetes(K8s) is a production-grade open-source container orchestration tool developed by Google to help you manage containerized/dockerized applications supporting multiple deployment environments like on-premise, cloud, or virtual machines.
